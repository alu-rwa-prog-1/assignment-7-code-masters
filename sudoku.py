# Sudoku game

# Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle

# The objective is to fill an n x n grid with digits, e.g., 4 x 4

# Every segment of the row, column, and 2 range contains all the numbers in the range

# The n x n grid will have some of the squares filled in at the beginning of the game

# The player’s work is to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid using logic.

# The moves will be incorrect if:
    #Any row contains more than one of the same number in the range
    # Whichever column contains more than one of the same number in the range
    # Any 2×2 grid contains more than one of the same number from the same range
